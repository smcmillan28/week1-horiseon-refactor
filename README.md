# Code Used
HTML/CSS

# Takeaways
In this assignment, there were a few examples of redundant CSS code and unnecessary class assignments. So there was a great deal of consilidating those.  One of the primary initial tasks was updating tags in the HTML to follow a semantic structure (i.e. changing < div > tags to something more specific like < aside > or < article > tags). The last main takeaway was updating titles and elements in the < head > tag for search engine optimization.  

# Credit/Contributions
There was a great deal of teamwork amongst our classmates and class instructors/TAs.  I definitely took advantage of that and asked questions/used their expertise.
